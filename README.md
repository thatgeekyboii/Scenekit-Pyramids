# Scenekit-Pyramids
A simple game using Scenekit


This game changes the background color as per the user clicked. Users are safe when they press the green pyramids and unsafe when the red ones are clicked.

The background changes to red if the wrong pyramids are selected and is again turned black once the green pyramid is selected.
